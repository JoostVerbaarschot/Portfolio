<h2>Profile</h2>

<p>
  As a 3D artist, I contributed to diverse projects, like Games, Rigging, 
  Animation Tools, MoCap, VR/AR Platforms combining creativity with 
  coding, debugging, and procedural systems to support artists 
  and enhance workflows. These experiences strengthened my 
  technical problem-solving skills and sparked a growing passion for 
  programming. This shift in focus led me to pursue a career in IT, where 
  I hope to apply and refine my technical expertise and problem-solving 
  abilities in a dedicated role
